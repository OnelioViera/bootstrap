      "description": "The Cowboy II project features two engineered grade beam designs: wider interior beams (45\"W) for interior installations and narrower exterior beams (27\"W) for perimeter rows. Both maintain 353.5\" length and 36\" height, ensuring consistent elevation while optimizing material usage. Lindsay Precast is manufacturing 23 interior and 46 exterior units, each incorporating custom rebar reinforcement and weighing approximately 49,000 lbs and 27,000 lbs per beam.",
